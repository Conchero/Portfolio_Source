# General Concept

The project is about making a portfolio myself with full devops pipeline 

The goal is to host on there my real time project aswell as my web project and to train the devops methods as I work on it 

The design will be made mobile first 

## Home page 

On arrival the user will have a list of all my project ordered by most recent to least recent with a paging system

If the user want to target specific types of projects or used technology it can select differents types of filters* that will update in real time the projects available

If no project was made with the selected filters then a message is shown on screen 

The projects have a card* that is clickable


## Project Page 

This page has the main project's pictures as the banner then below it has the title of the project 

Then a general description of the projects

Then a general developpement description 

it will have the stack used 

then pictures of the project as a slider (if more than one picture)
